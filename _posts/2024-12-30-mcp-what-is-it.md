title: MCP, what is it?
---

The way we manage, structure, and transfer information between AI components has become just as critical as the models themselves. As AI systems grow increasingly complex—often involving multiple specialized models working in concert—there's a pressing need for sophisticated infrastructure to connect these components. This is where Model Context Protocols (MCPs) enter the picture, serving as the transit system that enables intelligence to flow seamlessly between different parts of an AI ecosystem, providing access to capabilities and information that were previously siloed or inaccessible.

Most AI users have been exposed to the ability to attach something to their conversational AI of choice. This has been great, but imagine the possibilities when a company or user doesn't need to attach a doc, because their system is already paired with their CRM, OneDrive, SAP, etc. Previously you would need to hardcode all of these connections, opening up access to these other systems provides you with the ability to access and modify external systems, in a way that is very straightforward. This reminds me of how I felt the first time I was introduced to Heroku. This article will get more technical than other posts, so please feel free to copy and paste into your favorite tool to get a better understanding of the code.

## What Are Model Context Protocols?

At their core, Model Context Protocols are standardized frameworks that govern how context, instructions, and data flow between AI models and components within a system. Think of them as the diplomatic language that different AI models use to communicate effectively with each other and with the broader system architecture.

MCPs establish rules for packaging, transmitting, and interpreting contextual information—everything from user inputs and system instructions to memory management and tool usage. By defining these interactions through structured protocols, we can build more coherent, capable, and controllable AI systems.

## The Technical Foundation of MCPs

MCPs are built upon several fundamental technical principles that enable efficient model-to-model communication. The foundation of any MCP is how it represents context. Modern approaches typically use structured JSON objects providing clear schema for data exchange, vector embeddings capturing semantic meaning in high-dimensional space, and token-efficient formats minimizing context window consumption.

For example, a basic MCP might structure context like this:

```json
{
  "protocol_version": "1.0",
  "system_instructions": {
    "primary": "You are an assistant helping with data analysis",
    "constraints": ["Do not make up information", "Ask for clarification when needed"]
  },
  "conversation_history": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Can you analyze this dataset?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'd be happy to. What aspects would you like me to focus on?"}
  ],
  "tools": {
    "available": ["data_analyzer", "chart_generator"],
    "permissions": ["read_only"]
  },
  "memory": {
    "working": {},
    "long_term": {"user_preferences": {"detail_level": "technical"}}
  }
}
```

### Stateful Context Management

MCPs must define how context persists across interactions, including how long-term memory is maintained, which elements expire and when, and how to prioritize information when context limits are reached.

### Protocol Versioning and Compatibility

Like any good protocol, MCPs include versioning mechanisms to ensure backward compatibility while enabling evolution:

```python
def validate_protocol_compatibility(incoming_context):
    protocol_version = incoming_context.get("protocol_version", "0.1")
    if not is_compatible_version(protocol_version, CURRENT_VERSION):
        return apply_version_migration(incoming_context, protocol_version, CURRENT_VERSION)
    return incoming_context
```

## Key Components of Model Context Protocols

A comprehensive MCP typically includes several essential components. The system instructions layer defines the operating parameters for models, including role definitions and constraints, ethical guidelines and safety parameters, and output formatting requirements.

Conversation memory management establishes patterns for maintaining conversational context, determining which exchanges to preserve verbatim, when to summarize lengthy conversations, and how to handle context window limitations.

For AI systems that leverage external tools, MCPs specify how tools are registered and discovered, the format for tool calls and responses, and error handling for failed tool operations.

In multi-model systems, MCPs determine which model handles which types of requests, how to transfer context between specialized models, and when to parallelize processing across multiple models.

<tweet>A well-designed MCP is like a good API—it makes complex interactions feel simple and predictable.</tweet>

## Implementation Approaches

There are several strategies for implementing MCPs in production systems. In a centralized context manager approach, a dedicated service manages all context operations:

```python
class ContextManager:
    def __init__(self, protocol_version="1.0"):
        self.protocol_version = protocol_version
        self.active_contexts = {}
        
    def create_context(self, session_id, initial_context=None):
        """Initialize a new context for a session."""
        context = {
            "protocol_version": self.protocol_version,
            "session_id": session_id,
            "created_at": datetime.now().isoformat(),
            "system_instructions": DEFAULT_INSTRUCTIONS,
            "conversation_history": [],
            "memory": {"working": {}, "long_term": {}}
        }
        
        if initial_context:
            context = self._merge_contexts(context, initial_context)
            
        self.active_contexts[session_id] = context
        return context
    
    def update_context(self, session_id, update_data):
        """Update an existing context with new information."""
        if session_id not in self.active_contexts:
            raise KeyError(f"No active context found for session {session_id}")
            
        current = self.active_contexts[session_id]
        updated = self._merge_contexts(current, update_data)
        
        # Apply context window management if needed
        if self._is_context_too_large(updated):
            updated = self._compact_context(updated)
            
        self.active_contexts[session_id] = updated
        return updated
```

### Middleware Protocol Layers

Another approach uses middleware to handle protocol operations:

```python
class MCPMiddleware:
    def __init__(self, protocol_config):
        self.config = protocol_config
        
    async def process_incoming(self, request, context):
        """Process incoming requests before they reach models."""
        # Validate protocol conformance
        if not self._validate_protocol(request):
            return self._create_protocol_error_response(request)
            
        # Update context with new information
        updated_context = self._update_context(context, request)
        
        # Add metadata for tracking and logging
        request_with_metadata = self._add_request_metadata(request)
        
        return request_with_metadata, updated_context
        
    async def process_outgoing(self, response, context):
        """Process outgoing responses before they reach the client."""
        # Update context with response data
        updated_context = self._update_context_with_response(context, response)
        
        # Format response according to protocol
        formatted_response = self._format_response(response)
        
        return formatted_response, updated_context
```

### Distributed Protocol Enforcement

For larger systems, a distributed approach may be necessary:

```python
class DistributedMCP:
    def __init__(self, config, context_store):
        self.config = config
        self.context_store = context_store  # Redis, Cassandra, etc.
        
    async def get_context(self, session_id):
        """Retrieve context from distributed storage."""
        raw_context = await self.context_store.get(f"context:{session_id}")
        if not raw_context:
            return self._create_initial_context(session_id)
            
        return self._deserialize_context(raw_context)
        
    async def update_context(self, session_id, context_updates):
        """Update context in distributed storage with optimistic locking."""
        retry_count = 0
        while retry_count < MAX_RETRIES:
            current = await self.get_context(session_id)
            version = current.get("_version", 0)
            
            updated = self._merge_contexts(current, context_updates)
            updated["_version"] = version + 1
            
            success = await self.context_store.set(
                f"context:{session_id}",
                self._serialize_context(updated),
                condition=f"_version = {version}"
            )
            
            if success:
                return updated
                
            retry_count += 1
            await asyncio.sleep(RETRY_DELAY)
            
        raise ConcurrencyError("Failed to update context due to concurrent modifications")
```

## Getting Started with MCPs

If you're looking to implement MCPs in your AI system, here's a practical roadmap. Start by designing the schema that best fits your system needs. Consider what types of context your models need to share, how complex your system instructions are, what memory management approach makes sense for your use cases.

Build validation tooling to ensure protocol conformance:

```python
def validate_mcp_compliance(context):
    """Validate that a context object complies with MCP specifications."""
    required_fields = ["protocol_version", "system_instructions", "conversation_history"]
    
    for field in required_fields:
        if field not in context:
            return False, f"Missing required field: {field}"
    
    # Validate protocol version compatibility
    if not is_supported_version(context["protocol_version"]):
        return False, f"Unsupported protocol version: {context['protocol_version']}"
    
    # Validate conversation history format
    for entry in context.get("conversation_history", []):
        if "role" not in entry or "content" not in entry:
            return False, "Invalid conversation history format"
    
    return True, "Context is compliant with MCP specifications"
```

Start with a simple implementation:

```python
class SimpleContextManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.contexts = {}
    
    def create(self, session_id):
        """Create a new MCP-compliant context."""
        context = {
            "protocol_version": "1.0",
            "system_instructions": DEFAULT_INSTRUCTIONS,
            "conversation_history": [],
            "created_at": time.time()
        }
        self.contexts[session_id] = context
        return context
    
    def get(self, session_id):
        """Retrieve context for a session."""
        return self.contexts.get(session_id)
    
    def update(self, session_id, updates):
        """Update context with new information."""
        if session_id not in self.contexts:
            raise ValueError(f"No context found for session {session_id}")
        
        current = self.contexts[session_id]
        
        # Deep merge updates into current context
        updated = deep_merge(current, updates)
        
        # If context is too large, summarize older messages
        if self._estimate_token_count(updated) > MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS:
            updated = self._compact_context(updated)
        
        self.contexts[session_id] = updated
        return updated
```

Verify your protocol works across different models:

```python
async def test_cross_model_context_transfer():
    """Test that context transfers correctly between different models."""
    # Initialize context with the protocol
    context = context_manager.create("test_session")
    
    # Process with first model
    result1, updated_context = await process_with_model_a(
        "What's the capital of France?",
        context
    )
    
    # Verify context was updated correctly
    assert "Paris" in str(result1)
    assert len(updated_context["conversation_history"]) == 2
    
    # Transfer to second model with the same context
    result2, final_context = await process_with_model_b(
        "Tell me more about its history",
        updated_context
    )
    
    # Verify the second model maintained context
    assert "Paris" in str(result2)
    assert "France" in str(result2)
    assert len(final_context["conversation_history"]) == 4
```

## Use Cases for MCPs in Production

Let's explore some real-world applications of Model Context Protocols. In multi-stage content generation, a content creation system might use MCPs to coordinate specialized models where an ideation model generates content concepts, MCPs transfer these concepts to a drafting model, the draft flows to an editing model for refinement, and finally, MCPs route the content to a review model. Throughout this process, the MCP maintains consistent context about the original request, style guidelines, and previous iterations.

For AI assistants that leverage external tools, MCPs provide consistent patterns:

```python
# Example MCP-compliant tool call format
tool_call = {
    "tool_name": "database_query",
    "parameters": {
        "query": "SELECT * FROM customers WHERE region = 'Northeast'",
        "database": "sales_data"
    },
    "permissions": {
        "read_only": True,
        "max_rows": 1000
    },
    "call_id": "db_query_12345"
}

# Tool response format defined by the MCP
tool_response = {
    "call_id": "db_query_12345",
    "status": "success",
    "result_type": "table_data",
    "data": [...],  # Actual query results
    "metadata": {
        "execution_time": 0.23,
        "row_count": 347
    }
}
```

In distributed AI reasoning frameworks, complex reasoning tasks can be broken down into steps handled by different models where a planning model decomposes the problem into steps, MCPs facilitate each step being handled by specialized models, intermediate results are synthesized via the protocol, and a final model delivers the comprehensive solution.

## Challenges and Solutions

While powerful, MCPs come with implementation challenges. Context window limitations present a significant challenge as models have finite context windows, but protocols add overhead. The solution involves implementing dynamic context summarization, using token-efficient encodings, and prioritizing information based on recency and relevance:

```python
def optimize_context(context, max_tokens=3000):
    """Optimize context to fit within token limits."""
    current_tokens = estimate_token_count(context)
    
    if current_tokens <= max_tokens:
        return context
    
    # Clone context to avoid modifying original
    optimized = copy.deepcopy(context)
    
    # Preserve critical components
    critical_sections = ["system_instructions", "active_tools"]
    critical_tokens = sum(estimate_token_count(optimized.get(section, {})) 
                         for section in critical_sections)
    
    # Tokens available for conversation history
    history_token_budget = max_tokens - critical_tokens - TOKEN_BUFFER
    
    # Optimize conversation history
    history = optimized.get("conversation_history", [])
    optimized["conversation_history"] = compress_conversation_history(
        history, 
        max_tokens=history_token_budget
    )
    
    return optimized
```

Protocol versioning complexity can break compatibility when evolving protocols. The solution requires implementing robust versioning, creating protocol migration utilities, and designing for backward compatibility.

Multi-model orchestration faces the challenge that different models may interpret protocol elements differently. Solutions include creating model-specific adapters, implementing consistent validation, and developing comprehensive test suites.

## Performance Considerations

MCPs inevitably affect system performance, but strategic implementations can minimize overhead. A well-optimized MCP typically adds 2-5% overhead in terms of token consumption compared to unstructured contexts. This is a reasonable trade-off given the benefits in system coherence and capability.

Several approaches can enhance MCP performance through context pruning (dynamically removing irrelevant information, summarizing older conversation turns, compressing repeated instructions), parallel processing (processing independent protocol sections concurrently, using asynchronous updates for non-critical components), and caching strategies (caching frequently used protocol components, implementing lazy loading for infrequently accessed context).

## Future Developments in MCP Technology

The field of Model Context Protocols continues to evolve rapidly. Self-adapting protocols focus on protocols that can adapt to changing requirements, dynamically adjusting verbosity based on model performance, self-optimizing context structures for specific tasks, and learning from interaction patterns to improve efficiency.

As AI systems become more interconnected, we're seeing movement toward standardized MCPs with industry consortiums developing interoperability specifications, open-source protocol implementations gaining traction, and shared benchmarks for protocol performance.

Next-generation MCPs will incorporate advanced security features including fine-grained access controls for context components, cryptographic verification of context integrity, and privacy-preserving context sharing mechanisms.

<tweet>The future of AI isn't just smarter models—it's smarter communication between models. MCPs are the foundation of that future.</tweet>

## The Strategic Importance of MCPs

Model Context Protocols represent far more than technical plumbing—they're strategic assets that determine how effectively AI systems can coordinate, reason, and evolve. By implementing well-designed MCPs, organizations can achieve greater control, consistency, and capability from their AI systems. Beyond the technical benefits, they provide crucial governance mechanisms for ensuring AI systems behave as expected across a wide range of scenarios.

As you begin implementing MCPs in your own systems, consider starting with a focused use case rather than attempting to standardize all AI interactions at once. The most successful protocol implementations begin with clear needs and gradually expand as they prove their value.

The questions to consider as you explore MCPs include: How do your current AI systems handle context management, and what improvements could an MCP approach bring? What unique requirements might your organization have for an MCP implementation? How should MCPs evolve to address emerging AI capabilities like multimodal reasoning? What role should industry standards play in MCP development versus organization-specific protocols?

Model Context Protocols aren't just about making AI systems work better—they're about making them work together. In a world where AI capabilities are rapidly expanding, the systems that can effectively coordinate multiple AI components will have a significant advantage. MCPs provide the foundation for that coordination, turning isolated AI tools into integrated intelligence platforms.

The journey toward effective MCP implementation may seem complex, but the payoff is substantial: AI systems that are more capable, more reliable, and more aligned with organizational goals. As we move into an era of increasingly sophisticated AI applications, those organizations that master the art of AI orchestration through protocols like MCPs will be the ones that truly harness the transformative power of artificial intelligence.
