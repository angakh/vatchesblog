title: 'Full Page Screenshots in Web Browsers'
---

This is not a typical post, but I never knew about this feature and it's super useful. Have you ever taken multiple screenshots of a long web page? Have you ever printed a web page to pdf so you could share it with someone? Have you ever downloaded an extension to take a full-page screenshot? Well aparently web browsers offer various ways to capture full-page screenshots, allowing you to save entire web pages including content that extends beyond the visible screen area. Without having to jump through hoops.

## Google Chrome (worst)

Chrome provides a hidden full-page screenshot feature within its Developer Tools:

1. **Open Developer Tools**: Press `Ctrl + Shift + I` (Windows) or `Cmd + Option + I` (Mac)
2. **Open Command Menu**: Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + P` (Mac)
3. **Run Screenshot Command**: Type "screenshot" and select "Capture full size screenshot"

The screenshot will be automatically saved to your default Downloads folder.

## Mozilla Firefox (method two is super easy)

Firefox offers multiple methods for taking full-page screenshots:

### Method 1: Developer Tools
1. **Open Developer Tools**: Right-click on the page and select "Inspect Element" or press `Ctrl + Shift + I` (Windows) or `Cmd + Option + I` (Mac)
2. **Access Settings**: Click the "..." (three-dot) menu in the Developer Tools toolbar
3. **Enable Screenshot Tool**: Select "Settings" and check "Take a screenshot of the entire page" under "Available Toolbox Buttons"
4. **Take Screenshot**: Click the camera icon that appears in the toolbar

### Method 2: Built-in Screenshot Tool
1. Right-click anywhere on the webpage
2. Select "Take Screenshot"
3. Click "Save full page" in the screenshot interface
4. Click "Download" to save the image
