---

I have been talking to a lot of VC firms lately and I thought of something that I would love your feedback on. Do you think AI is going to create a wave of ideas that are similar in nature?

Here is my simple definition of Venture capital (VC) firms for those that are not aware. A VC is an entity that invests in companies in exchange for equity in that company. What they invest can be anything from money to people and time. The goal is to have a successful exit, which in most cases is defined by increasing that companies value X times their initial investment. An exit can be when the company goes to another round of funding, when it goes public, or when it is sold.

In working with some VCs and startups I have realized that they have really embraced AI and ML. They have a lot of data to go through and the help of AI/ML is very helpful in consolidating information and presenting it in a meaningful way. Startups have also leveraged this, even if the startup is not concentrating on AI it is part of their strategy every step of the way. I think that companies that start with the right approach to their data will have a serious advantage to those that don't.

But what has me really thinking is the future impact of AI on the startup ecosystem and how that will impact VC firms. I remember brainstorming with friends once a week on startup ideas. What were we going to do next, what was the next market, the next big idea. Coming up with the right idea is all about the customer first. "Who needs help with something?" And the next question is "How much are they willing to pay for it?". Doing the research, finding the right customer, and finding the right product to give them what they want or need. These are all difficult questions to answer uniquely.

A lot of times the ideas you come up with are not already thought up, they are out there making money already! *Side note*: if you have felt that way with your ideas, just remember this: you came up with an idea that was successful. That means you are asking the right questions, so keep trying.

In the future if people are using AI to come up with ideas and strategies there is a very high chance that a lot of startups with very similar ideas will be popping up at the same time. What happens then? It will be like Hollywood where people are like "you want to go see that asteroid move?" and the only way you can identify which one they are talking about is by naming the actors because there are two or three movies with the same premise.

The first thing that stood out to me in this experiment was that the responses had some similarities in the order of which they were presented. Personal and virtual fitness first, then mental health, then fitness. These were two totally different LLMs and they had a very similar response. As one drills down further into each the possibility of coming up with something very similar seems high.

Ultimately the market decides what is successful and what is not, but I wonder if these advances are going to create a lot of junk startups or if they are going to bring a new wave of innovation that we could not have imagined. What does this mean for VC firms? Are they going to get bogged down with dozens of the same type of company? Recently I spoke to a VC partner that was complaining about the number of chat-bot ideas that people want to pitch him and how they were all the same exact idea.
